### What Gets Analyzed

The AI considers these factors when analyzing vehicles:

- **Price vs. Market Value** (accounting for auction discounts)
- **Vehicle Age vs. Mileage** appropriateness
- **Condition Issues** (distinguishing cosmetic vs. mechanical)
- **Repair Cost Estimates** for known damage
- **Auction Context** (expects some issues, focuses on value)
- **Risk Level** based on all factors

## Understanding the Analysis

### Recommendation Types

- **BUY** üü¢: Great deal, low risk, recommended purchase
- **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** üü°: Potentially good deal but with notable risks
- **PASS** üî¥: Poor value or too risky for most buyers

### Score Breakdown

The overall score (1-10) directly determines the recommendation using these thresholds:

- **8-10** ‚Üí **BUY** üü¢: Excellent value with minimal risk
- **5-7** ‚Üí **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** üü°: Good value with manageable risk  
- **1-4** ‚Üí **PASS** üî¥: Poor value or high risk

*Note: The extension automatically ensures score-recommendation alignment for consistent results.*

### Price Ratings

- **EXCELLENT**: Significantly below market value
- **GOOD**: Below market value with good savings
- **FAIR**: Around expected auction price
- **OVERPRICED**: Above reasonable auction value

## Privacy & Security

- **API Key Storage**: Your OpenAI API key is stored locally in Chrome's secure storage
- **Data Handling**: Vehicle data is only sent to OpenAI for analysis
- **No Tracking**: The extension doesn't collect or transmit personal data
- **Secure Communication**: All API calls use HTTPS encryption

## API Costs

The extension uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo model. Typical costs:
- **Per Analysis**: ~$0.02-0.05 USD
- **Monthly Usage**: $5-20 USD for moderate use (100-400 analyses)

You can monitor usage in your [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension doesn't detect vehicle data**:
- Refresh the auction page and try again
- Make sure you're on a vehicle listing page (not search results)
- Some sites may require scrolling to load all data

**Analysis fails**:
- Check your OpenAI API key in settings
- Verify you have API credits available
- Check browser console for error messages

**Slow analysis**:
- AI analysis typically takes 10-30 seconds
- Slow internet or high OpenAI API load can cause delays

### Getting Help

1. Check browser console (`F12` ‚Üí Console) for error messages
2. Verify extension permissions in `chrome://extensions/`
3. Try refreshing the auction page and re-analyzing
